    <h1>Tribute to Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <h2>A Visionary Leader</h2>
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi, known as the Father of the Nation in India, was a beacon of hope and resilience. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and truth transformed the struggle for India's independence into a global symbol of peaceful resistance.</p>

    <h2>Principles of Nonviolence</h2>
    <p>Gandhi championed <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (nonviolence) and <strong>Satyagraha</strong> (truth force), advocating for peaceful protests and civil disobedience. His belief in the power of nonviolent resistance inspired countless movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.</p>

        <li><strong>Quit India Movement (1942):</strong> Gandhi called for an end to British rule in India, uniting millions in a powerful movement.</li>
    </ul>
